## PROJECT DESCRIPTION



**The Basics of User Experience Design**
According to `d.school` (book), there are five phases of design thinking as shown in the image below, according to d.school, are as follows: 
- **Empathize** – with your users
- **Define** – your users’ needs, their problem, and your insights
- **Ideate** – by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions
- **Prototype** – to start creating solutions
- **Test** – solutions

It is important to note that the `five phases`, stages, or modes are not always sequential. They do not have to follow any specific order. What’s more, they can often occur in parallel and repeat iteratively. As such, you should not envision the phases as a hierarchal or step-by-step process. Instead, you should understand it as an overview of the modes or phases that contribute to an innovative project, rather than sequential steps.
